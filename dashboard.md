CRM Dashboard
What should actually be on it (core, not fancy)

Think of the dashboard as answering 3 questions in 10 seconds:

How is the business doing?

Where should I focus today?

What changed recently?

If your dashboard answers these clearly, you win.

1️⃣ Top KPI Summary (Non-negotiable)

These go at the very top. Clean, calm, no clutter.

KPIs to show (4–6 max)

Pick metrics that mean something to leadership:

Total Leads

Qualified Leads

Total Customers

Conversion Rate (Leads → Customers)

Revenue (or Estimated Revenue)

Active Deals / Opportunities

Each KPI card should include:

Main value

% change vs previous period (↑ ↓)

Time context (This month / Last 30 days)

💡 Why this matters:
This shows you understand business metrics, not just UI.

2️⃣ Sales / Leads Funnel (Most Important Graph)

This is the heart of a CRM dashboard.

Funnel stages (example)

New Leads

Contacted

Qualified

Proposal Sent

Won

Lost

Visualization

Funnel chart or

Horizontal bar chart showing drop-off

What it answers:

Where leads are leaking

Where sales team should focus

💬 This single graph alone can justify the dashboard’s existence.

3️⃣ Leads Over Time (Trend, Not Noise)

A simple time-series chart.

Show:

New leads per day / week / month

Optional: overlay conversions

Controls:

Time range selector (7d / 30d / 90d)

💡 Keep it simple.
No stacked madness. One or two lines max.

4️⃣ Revenue / Deal Value Trend (If Applicable)

If your CRM supports deals or estimated revenue:

Line or area chart

Shows revenue growth or decline

Monthly aggregation is enough

If not using real revenue:
👉 Use “Pipeline Value” or “Potential Revenue”

This shows forecasting awareness, which managers love.

5️⃣ Lead Source Breakdown (Decision-Making Gold)

This is subtle but very impressive.

Examples:

Website

Referral

Ads

Email Campaign

Cold Outreach

Visualization:

Pie chart or horizontal bar chart

What it answers:

“Where are good leads coming from?”

This proves your CRM isn’t just tracking data — it’s guiding strategy.

6️⃣ Recent Activity Feed (Daily Focus)

This section answers: “What’s happening right now?”

Show:

Recently added leads

Status changes

Follow-ups due today

Notes added

Deals closed

Format:

Timeline / feed

Human-readable entries
(“John Doe moved to Qualified”)

This is extremely realistic and shows product thinking.

7️⃣ Actionable Tasks / Follow-Ups (Optional but Strong)

A small but powerful block.

Show:

Follow-ups due today

Overdue activities

Upcoming calls / meetings

This turns the dashboard from passive analytics into an active work hub.
